# Ecology of Animal Societies - Bookdown Template

This is a small template for a {[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)} document that can be used to collect multiple Rmarkdown scripts for a coherent project documentation.

To be able to use this in your own projects you will need to `R` as well as the {bookdown} package installed:

```r
install.packages("bookdown")
```

Note, that the template also uses the (non-cran) package {[emo](https://github.com/hadley/emo)} to be able to use emojis within Rmarkdown.

To be able to do this as well, install {emo} with the {[remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/)} package:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hadley/emo")
```

Please have a look at the [compiled documentation](https://k-hench.github.io/eas_bookdown/) for more information about this template.
